Data Structure Assignment 5 // Name : Amr Ayman Ibrahim Momtaz // ID : 18011178

Notes:

1) I have implemented both Array Based and Linked List based Stacks in the program

2) The Capacity for the array based stacks is 1000

3) The Junit tests for the array based are the same for the linked list stacks excpect that I removed the stack overflow exception thrown in the array stack form the linked list based stacks(Since the linked list has a lot of capacity which is all the heap)

4) I have provided one user interface that uses the linked lists based stacks and if you want to try it with the Array based stacks you will have to change the class in the user interface only.
